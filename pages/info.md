This is the homepage of the CV Lab at the University of Sydney. We fork this website from [SIGMA Lab](https://sigmalab-usyd.github.io) in 2019 with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). 

Our website is user-friendly, highly modularized and could be personalized very quickly! If you'd like to, you can build your own academic website for free based on our framework. The code of our website is available on [Github](https://github.com/USYD-CVLab/usyd-cvlab.github.io). For commercial use, please contact [Prof. Ouyang](https://wlouyang.github.io/) for details.
